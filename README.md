 Read pulse length from Spektrum 2.4 Ghz Reciever AUX Channel for accessory control
 3 LEDs are hooked up as outputs to give a visual indication of the position of the AUX
 signal as read from the Rx.

Eventually, I will build a cool RC Truck Accessory such as a winch, lights, camera gimbal, etc.

Also note that this can easily be powered by the 5v in from the reciever if the accessory does not
draw alot of current, but I assume it may start to malfunction when the voltage drops.
